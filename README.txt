README

In order to run the code, there are 5 main files. All of these contain the methods
to perform the respective algorithms on the 2 datasets. They create the figures used
in the analysis. Each of these also generate a .txt file in the results folder which
summarizes the performance of the algorithms:

1. nn.py
2. boosting.py
3. decision_tree.py
4. knn.py
5. svm.py

Run the file based on which algorithm you need to run.

Additionally, there are 2 helper files:

1. data.py --> opens the datasets used.
2. plotting.py --> plots all the figures generated.

The datasets are both contained in the root folder:

1. balance-scale.data.txt
2. wdbc.data.txt

Check out the results folder to see the performance of all 5 algorithms on the 2 datasets.
Check out the figures folder to see the images used in the report.
